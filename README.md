# Open ID



## What is OpenID Connect and what is OpenID Connect used for?


OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an open authentication protocol that profiles and extends OAuth 2.0 to add an identity layer. OIDC allows clients to confirm an end userâ€™s identity using authentication by an authorization server. Implementing OIDC on top of OAuth 2.0 creates a single framework that promises to secure APIs, mobile native applications and browser applications in a single, cohesive architecture.
